# NOTES — append only

Decision log and failure log. **A judged deliverable** — the panel asks what
broke and how you recovered. Do not tidy this up. Append, never rewrite.

Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD — short title`, then what happened, what you did, what
you'd do differently.

## 2026-08-27 — handoff from research phase

Research complete, no production code. Moving to local build in Claude Code.

Carried over: six self-found errors (see `docs/03_ERRORS.md`), all of which
flattered the project. Current results in `docs/02_RESULTS.md` — headline is
deliberately conditional, not a single number.

Known open failure: **S1 belief calibration fails** (ECE 0.098 vs 0.10
threshold, non-monotone reliability curve, overconfident in top decile). Left
failing on purpose. The threshold was declared before results were seen.
